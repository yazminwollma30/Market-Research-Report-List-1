<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Methacrylic Acid (MAA) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Acetone Cyanohydrin Method</li><li>Isobutylene Oxidation Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Methacrylic Acid (MAA) is primarily produced through two methods: the Acetone Cyanohydrin Method and the Isobutylene Oxidation Method. The Acetone Cyanohydrin Method involves reacting acetone with cyanide to form methacrylonitrile, which is then hydrolyzed to yield MAA. In contrast, the Isobutylene Oxidation Method uses isobutylene and oxygen to directly synthesize MAA through oxidation. Each method varies in terms of efficiency, environmental impact, and production cost, influencing the market dynamics and competitive landscape in the MAA industry.</p></p>
